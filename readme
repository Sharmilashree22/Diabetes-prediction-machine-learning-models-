# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes based on a medical dataset. The dataset includes various medical and health-related variables from 1000 patients in Iraq, sourced from the Medical City Hospital and the Specialized Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes at Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains both continuous and categorical variables, including:
- **Age**: Age of the patient (Continuous)
- **Urea**: Urea levels in the blood (Continuous)
- **Creatinine (Cr)**: Serum creatinine concentration (Continuous)
- **HbA1c**: Hemoglobin A1c levels reflecting long-term blood glucose (Continuous)
- **Cholesterol (Chol)**: Total cholesterol levels (Continuous)
- **Triglycerides (TG)**: Blood triglycerides concentration (Continuous)
- **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)**: "Good" cholesterol levels (Continuous)
- **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)**: "Bad" cholesterol levels (Continuous)
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Body mass index (Continuous)
- **Gender**: Gender of the patient (Categorical)
- **Diabetes Status**: The target variable indicating if the patient is Non-Diabetic, Prediabetic, or Diabetic (Categorical)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Various machine learning models for classification:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - XGBoost
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - AdaBoost Classifier

## Project Structure
- **diabetes.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and model development.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies for running the notebook.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sharmilashree22/Diabetes-prediction-machine-learning-models-.git
    ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `diabetes.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells to explore data, train models, and evaluate their performance.
3. Use the trained models to predict diabetes status on new data.

## Results

The machine learning models are trained to predict whether a patient is:
- **Non-Diabetic**
- **Prediabetic**
- **Diabetic**

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
